In other words, anything in this repository should be regarded as tentative and subject to change. It is published here to allow early access and trial and to solicit early feedback.

__IMPORTANT NOTICE 2:__ This repository is being discontinued and will not be updated further. Instead, examples will, as of [Drop 3](https://github.com/Ericsson/eiffel/milestones/Drop%203), be included in the [Eiffel repository](https://github.com/Ericsson/eiffel).
